Infrastructure as Code is the linking inbetween all the different ways to open the code. From my understanding the Terraform creates the infrastructure by running a Docker image with the code. Docker will open a container, which is a space where the code can run without having to confirm to windows logic. 

This can be very helpfull for a long project. Running the terraform file will gather all the necessary files to work on. Yet on smaller projects getting the configuration file will occupy more time then it will save.

Terraform is the root of all. It starts from a configuration file with limited code and opens the necessary locations for you to get working on it.
