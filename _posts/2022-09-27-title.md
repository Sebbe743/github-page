As far as my knowledge goes, a pipeline is a way to use github for having a more direct connection working on projects. Pushes get replaced with packages. I think this can be very useful and speed up tasks with multiple people working on. It also helps detected errors faster. It also assists both the software developer and the IT operators, when there is a lot of testing.
